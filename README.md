# long-term-impact-of-fairness-constraints
This repository can be used for analysing the long-term impact of static fairness constraints.  
- The functions and classes for our model are in "fico_util.py", "util.py", and "eq_odds.py".  
- We present the applications of our model with Jupyter Notebook.
